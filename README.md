# Natural Language Processing
*-> Spam and Non Spam classifiers.
* Data preprocessing has been done initially.
* Here i have used different classifiers  models.
* and finally chosen the random forest classifier model which gives good accuracy compared to other 4 models.

*->Hate speech/offensive words prediction
* The second project in NLP
* Here i have learned how to preprocess the unstructured data to structured data
* applied classification models for the prediction
* finally for this xgboost classifier has high accuracy in prediction.
* hence ths xgboost classifier works better for this data.
